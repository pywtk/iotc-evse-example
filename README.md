## Workspace build instructions
1. Open up MCUXpresso IDE1.
2. When asked to open a workspace navigate to the nxpev10642 dir.
3. You will hopefully see an IDE with 3 projects there, compile all of them
  (you may need to open up the SDK manager first & ensure that the "evkmimxrt1064" board SDK is installed)
